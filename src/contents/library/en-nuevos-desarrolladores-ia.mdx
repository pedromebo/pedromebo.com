## The Rise of AI-Driven Developers: A False Sense of Control

In recent years, **artificial intelligence (AI)** has revolutionized the software development landscape. With tools like **code assistants**, high-level frameworks, and smart IDEs, more and more people are venturing into creating applications and technological solutions without having a programming or development background. AI has democratized access to development, enabling more people to quickly create solutions.  
Obviously, more people can discover this sector thanks to these tools and achieve their goals in an easy way. However, there is a significant difference between having the ability to create a solution and having control over it.  
Thus, this accessibility raises an important question:

> Can we be good developers with just a good code assistant?

## The Developer and the F1 Driver

Let's take the example of someone using a racing simulator, like in F1. There are extremely realistic simulators/games where anyone can sit down, grab the wheel, and feel the adrenaline of high-speed cornering, make several laps, and get a good time. But driving a virtual car doesn't make you a professional driver. In reality, a driver must deeply understand vehicle behavior, race dynamics, and make complex decisions under pressure in unpredictable environments.

## The Superficial Developer

The same is true in the world of software development. Developers who rely solely on AI can create functional projects, but lack the deep understanding required to:

- Solve complex problems.
- Optimize performance.
- Build fail-proof solutions.

They don't fully grasp how **data structures**, **algorithms**, or fundamental software design principles work, which limits them when things don't go as planned.

## What Distinguishes a True Developer?

AI is a powerful tool, but it doesn't replace the solid knowledge base that distinguishes experienced developers. Without understanding the **"why"** behind the code, AI-driven developers are only scratching the surface of the potential they could reach.

In conclusion, we are at a time when AI is an extremely useful tool for recommending code based on our decisions, but it should be developers who make the decisions and know how to build each solution.  
Thus, it will still be necessary to study and practice data structures, design patterns, and optimizations to become good developers, even if we use AI to help us learn it.
