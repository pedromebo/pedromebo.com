# Multi-Agent System in C++

## Introduction

This project develops a Multi-Agent System with a custom simulation loop, notable for its significant performance improvements. The key aspects implemented are detailed below:

### üß† Body/Mind Separation
- Separates the agent's control logic (mind) from its physical representation (body)
- Allows for greater flexibility and scalability in the simulation

### üîÑ Finite State Machine (FSM)
- Agents use an FSM to efficiently switch between behaviors
- Adaptation based on conditions and environment

### üêù Flocking Behavior
- Coordinated movement of agents, mimicking animal swarms
- Ideal for simulations with multiple entities

### üó∫Ô∏è Pathfinding (A* Algorithm)
- Implementation of the A* algorithm to find optimal paths
- Ensures agents avoid obstacles and reach goals efficiently

### ‚ö° Optimized Path Calculations
- Dynamic adjustment of calculations based on the required level of detail
- Reduces computational load and improves overall performance
