**Oona the Druid's Path** is a 2.5D platformer game developed in **Unreal Engine 4** as an academic project at [ESAT Valencia](https://www.esat.es/) in collaboration with [Berklee Music](https://valencia.berklee.edu/).

This game is set in a forest within a magical world inspired by medieval Galicia. The protagonist, a young novice named **Oona**, faces the first of her thirteen trials to become a druid: **sealing the portal of souls** on the night of **Samhain** so that the souls leave the world of the living and return to the afterlife, where they belong.

>## Developed Tasks

Some of the main tasks I performed within the programming team are:

- Implementation of **FMOD** 
- Implementation of **SFX** and the **OST**
- Implementation of **user interfaces (UI)**
- Design and implementation of the **interaction system**
- **Optimization and performance improvements**
- Coordination of composers with the team
