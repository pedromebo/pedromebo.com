> ## Introduction
In today's post, we will discuss a collection of GitHub repositories filled with resources, projects, and books that can greatly help us learn a new technology or deepen our knowledge in one.

These resources are called "Awesome," and they are repositories created by users that list valuable content for research, projects, tools, books, tutorials, or guides.

Most of them are links to other repositories, portfolios, videos, or books.

Many of the "awesome" lists are grouped in this repository where you can search and filter what you need.

> ## How to Search for Content within the Awesome Project?
This project by user [*sindresorhus*](https://github.com/sindresorhus/) has over 143k stars and almost 19k forks.

For example, let's say we want to learn Machine Learning in Python. First, we search for Python and see a set of subgroups.

We head to Data Science.

This will redirect us to a new Awesome project but this time specifically for [Data Science](https://github.com/krzjoa/awesome-python-data-science).

As you can see, the content is vast, and you can select the content that interests you the most.
